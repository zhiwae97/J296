<h1> Data Diary: Presidential Campaign Finance </h1>
  
<p> Below is the data diary of my analysis on the campaign finance of the 1996 Presidential Election. The data I analyzed here is provided by the Federal Election Commissions about donations totaling more than $100,000 to the Republican and Democratic entities backing Bill Clinton and Bob Dole’s presidential campaigns. This data covers the date from January 1995 to December 1996.</p>
